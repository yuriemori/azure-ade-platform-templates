## Environment Definitions

### Secure Web Application (`secure-webapp`)

A complete, production-ready web application environment following Azure security best practices.

**Components:**
- Frontend and Backend App Services (containerized)
- Azure SQL Database with private connectivity
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall
- Application Insights for monitoring
- Virtual Network with proper segmentation
- Managed Identity for passwordless authentication

**Use Cases:**
- Full-stack web applications
- Microservices architectures
- Secure enterprise applications
- Development, staging, and production environments

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Follow the [ADE-SETUP.md](./ADE-SETUP.md) guide to configure Azure Deployment Environments
2. **Deploy**: Use the Developer Portal or Azure CLI to create environments
3. **Customize**: Modify templates to meet your specific requirements

## Key Features

### Security First
- Managed Identity for all service authentication
- Private endpoints for database and key vault access
- VNet integration for network isolation
- Web Application Firewall protection
- RBAC for fine-grained access control

### Production Ready
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- High availability configurations
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Disaster recovery considerations
- Cost optimization features

### Developer Friendly
- Self-service deployment through Developer Portal
- Parameterized templates for different environments
- Clear documentation and examples
- Consistent naming conventions

## Template Standards

All environment definitions in this catalog follow these standards:

### File Structure
- `manifest.yaml`: Environment metadata and parameters
- `main.bicep`: Primary infrastructure template
- `README.md`: Detailed documentation

### Naming Conventions
- Resources use consistent naming with environment prefix
- Unique suffixes prevent naming conflicts
- Clear resource type identification

### Parameter Design
- Required parameters for essential configuration
- Sensible defaults for optional parameters
- Validation where appropriate
- Clear descriptions and examples

### Security Requirements
- Managed Identity for service authentication
- Private endpoints for sensitive services
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Secrets management through Key Vault
- HTTPS enforcement where applicable

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Environment Definitions

1. Create a new directory under `environment-definitions/`
2. Add required files: `manifest.yaml`, `main.bicep`, `README.md`
3. Follow naming and security standards
4. Test deployment in development environment
5. Update catalog documentation

### Modifying Existing Templates

1. Update the Bicep template with required changes
2. Modify manifest.yaml if parameters change
3. Update README.md documentation
4. Test changes thoroughly
5. Version appropriately

### Parameter Guidelines

- Use descriptive names and clear descriptions
- Provide sensible defaults where possible
- Use validation rules for user input
- Group related parameters logically
- Document parameter relationships

## Best Practices

### Development
